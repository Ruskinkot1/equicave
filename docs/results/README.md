# Results

Every file here is written by a script and carries its protocol in the header. Nothing is edited by hand.
A number that is absent is absent on purpose: the run did not happen, or did not converge.

| file | produced by | content |
|---|---|---|
| `native_candidates_build.log` | `scripts/train/build_native.py` | candidate ceiling, mean candidates, timing over the whole manifest |
| `ranker_native.md` / `.json` | `scripts/train/train_ranker.py` | LambdaRank cross-validation by cluster, seeds, feature-group ablations, paired bootstrap |
| `ranker_peptide.md` / `.json` | the same, `--tag peptide` | the peptide-site benchmark, with and without the peptide feature group |
| `methods_comparison.md` / `.json` | `scripts/eval/compare_methods.py` | native, fpocket and P2Rank candidates on the same structures, each with and without the learned ranker |
| `eval_<set>.md` / `.json` | `scripts/eval/evaluate.py` | one benchmark under the shared protocol; `train-similar` structures are a separate row |
| `ablations.md` / `.json` | `scripts/train/collect_ablations.py` | the network ablation grid, mean ± seed sd, paired against `full` |

Conventions in every table: success is DCA ≤ 4 Å (DCC reported where available); N is the structure's own number of
ligand sites; intervals are 95 % cluster bootstraps; gains carry a paired cluster bootstrap; "not run" means not run.

## Negative results worth keeping

**Re-centring a candidate does not improve DCC** (measured 2026-10-04 on 111 hitting candidates). Six definitions of
a candidate's centre — buriedness-weighted centroid (the one we use), plain centroid, the peak point, the centroid of
the deepest half, an interaction-potential-weighted centroid, and the centroid of points that can make three or more
interactions — all give DCC ≤ 4 Å between 0.505 and 0.577 and DCC ≤ 10 Å of 0.982, with DCA ≤ 4 Å essentially 1.0.
The distance from any reasonable centre to the ligand *centroid* is about 3.6 Å because the cavity point cloud is
larger than the ligand, so the low DCC at a 4 Å threshold is a property of the threshold, not of our centres. This
supports the LIGYSIS recommendation to report DCC at 10-12 Å, and it closes re-centring as an avenue for improving
that metric.
